# Generated Code Directory

This directory contains executable analysis code that can be run locally to generate visualizations and perform data analysis.

## Files

### `consensus_metrics.py`
The core analysis pipeline that performs:
- Text embedding generation using Mistral's `mistral-embed` model
- Dimensionality reduction with t-SNE
- Optimal clustering with K-means (using silhouette scores)
- Topic modeling with TF-IDF
- Sentiment analysis

**Usage:**
```bash
python generated_code/consensus_metrics.py
```

### `analysis.py` (Auto-generated)
This file is automatically generated from Dev agent's output on each run of `main.py`. It contains all the Python code that Dev creates during the analysis, including:
- Data processing and transformations
- Statistical analyses
- Visualizations
- Any enhancements or extensions specified by the Spec agent

**Usage:**
```bash
python generated_code/analysis.py
```

**Note:** This file is regenerated on each run and is not committed to version control (see `.gitignore`). It provides a way to reproduce Dev's visualizations locally without running the full agent pipeline.

## Purpose

This directory provides:
1. **Reproducibility**: Execute Dev's code locally to regenerate visualizations
2. **Transparency**: All analysis code is visible and editable
3. **Debugging**: Easier to debug and modify generated code when needed
4. **Organization**: Clear separation between system orchestration code (`main.py`) and analysis code

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed all dependencies:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mistral
```

Or using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Variables

Set up your `.env` file with:
```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FILE_PATH=path/to/your/data.csv
```
