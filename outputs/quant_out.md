# **Executive Summary**

- **Thematic Convergence**: Participants showed the strongest alignment on questions Q1a, Q1c, and Q2, indicating clear consensus on these topics.
- **Sentiment Trends**: Overall sentiment was slightly positive, with no significant differences in sentiment across questions.
- **Participant Dynamics**: Three main participant groups were identified, with some individuals emerging as more central and influential in discussions.
- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Focus on High-Consensus Themes**: Leverage the strong alignment on Q1a, Q1c, and Q2 to drive decision-making and next steps.
  2. **Engage Influential Participants**: Target the central participants to help align and guide the broader group, especially in areas of lower consensus.

# **Deep Dive**

## **Thematic Analysis**

### **How Themes Evolved**
- The analysis measured how similar participants’ responses were across different questions using a method called **Jaccard similarity** (a way to compare sets of ideas and see how much they overlap).
- The highest similarity was found for **Q1a, Q1c, and Q2**, meaning participants largely agreed on these topics.
- Other questions showed more diversity in responses, suggesting less consensus.

### **Key Values**
- Thematic similarity was visualized in a **heatmap**, where darker colors indicate higher agreement.
- For example, the similarity between Q1a and Q1c was among the highest, indicating participants used similar language and ideas in their responses.

## **Sentiment Trends**

### **Interpretation of Sentiment**
- Sentiment scores ranged from -0.75 (negative) to 1.0 (positive), with an average of 0.035 (slightly positive).
- A statistical test (Kruskal-Wallis) showed no significant differences in sentiment across questions (p=0.5972), meaning participants’ feelings about the topics were generally consistent.

### **Visualization**
- A **boxplot** was created to show sentiment distribution by question. Most questions clustered around neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

## **Participant Dynamics**

### **Influential Participants**
- Participants were grouped into three clusters based on their sentiment and thematic focus.
- Some participants were more central in the discussion network, suggesting they had a stronger influence on the group’s direction.

### **Visualization**
- A **scatter plot** and **network graph** were used to visualize these clusters and connections.

# **Recommendations**

1. **Leverage High-Consensus Themes**
   - Use the strong agreement on Q1a, Q1c, and Q2 to move forward with action items related to these topics.

2. **Engage Central Participants**
   - Involve the most influential participants in facilitating discussions, especially for questions with lower consensus.

3. **Monitor Sentiment**
   - While sentiment is generally positive, keep an eye on any shifts, particularly in questions with more diverse responses.

# **Limitations**

- The analysis is based on a fixed dataset and may not capture all nuances of participant interactions.
- The sample size for some questions may be small, limiting the generalizability of the results.
