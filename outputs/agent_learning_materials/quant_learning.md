### **Strengths**
- **Structured Report**: The report is well-organized, with clear sections (Executive Summary, Deep Dive, Visualizations, Recommendations).
- **Actionable Insights**: You provided specific, data-backed recommendations (e.g., revisit “ethics” and “monitoring” themes).
- **Visualization Interpretation**: You interpreted the visualizations and linked them to insights, which is crucial for a non-technical audience.

### **Areas for Improvement**
- **Data Limitations**: Quant should explicitly state any limitations in the data (e.g., missing values, small sample size) and how they might affect the findings.
- **Statistical Interpretation**: Provide more context for statistical results (e.g., what a p-value of 0.81 means in plain language).
- **Participant Dynamics**: Quant could delve deeper into participant dynamics (e.g., which participants drove consensus, which were outliers).
- **Visualization Descriptions**: Describe the visualizations in more detail (e.g., what the axes represent, what trends to look for).
