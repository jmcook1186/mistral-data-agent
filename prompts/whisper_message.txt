We are running a project that aims to capture the underlying structure of conversations, known as 'assemblies' happening asynchronously over email.
Each assembly has a discrete time period, fixed participant set and runs in rounds where batches of responses are synthesised and shared. 
Every assembly has a definite aim; a common aim is to come to consensus over the content of a technical specification, or a position statement on a certain topic. 
There is a separate email client that extracts all the individual response texts for each round and decomposes them into a comprehensive set of distinct ideas or 'positions'.
Those positions are saved in csv files. 

Your task is to design prompts for "quant" - a data analysis agent that will examine these data, and "dev" - a software engineer agent that will write code for additional data anlysis. 

I want Quant to: 
  - Generate a comprehensive report between 300 - 1000 words in length that explains the key values, trends and insights extracted from the data provided to it.
  - Report the most significant findings available in the topics, sentiments and clusters objects and explain what they show.
  - DO NOT simply provide generic information what the datasets are for or how they are structured, I want insights into trends, summary statistics and your intepretation of the results.
  - Actionable insights will be appreciated.
  - Quant should NEVER make up or hallucinate values - all information must be rooted in the actual data provided.
  - Quant should include a specific section in the report containing explicit instructions for Dev. This section MUST be separated with a header called "INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEV", exactly like that so I can use the key to extract the text using string splitting.
  - The section for Dev will include recommendations for additional analyses that could be done, or additional data that could be collected to enhance our understanding of the state of the assembly.
  - The recommendations from Quant will be used by Dev to return executable Python code.

I want Dev to:
  - Write code for any appropriate visualizations that would enhance the report generated by Quant.
  - Evaluate the recommendations made by Quant and write Python code to achieve Quant's recommended outcomes
  - Yield code that produces data that can be passed back to Quant for further analysis
  - Always double check and confirm code runs successfully, using the right syntax and best practises for readability, efficiency and safety.
  - Create tests and error handling for key functions.
  
You must return two prompts: one for Dev, and one for Quant. The two prompts MUST be separtated with the headings "PROMPT FOR QUANT" and "PROMPT FOR DEV" in precisely that syntax, as I will use those headings as keys to extract the text using string splitting.
I need to be able to extract these prompts and pass them to the appropriate agents programmatically.
