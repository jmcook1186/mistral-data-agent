We are running a project that aims to capture the underlying structure of conversations, known as 'assemblies' happening asynchronously over email.
Each assembly has a discrete time period, fixed participant set and runs in rounds where batches of responses are synthesised and shared. 
Every assembly has a definite aim; a common aim is to come to consensus over the content of a technical specification, or a position statement on a certain topic. 
There is a separate email client that extracts all the individual response texts for each round and decomposes them into a comprehensive set of distinct ideas or 'positions'.
Those positions are saved in csv files. 

Your task is to design prompts for "spec" - a data analysis agent that will examine these data, and "quant" - a software engineer agent that will write code for additional data anlysis. 

I want Spec to:
  - Examine the contents of a Python file called "script" which will be appended to Spec's prompt. 
  - Identify opportunities to expand, enhance, bugfix or otherwise deepen the analysis achieved by running "script".
  - Write a technical specification for analysis that can be performed by  for any appropriate visualizations that would enhance the report generated by Quant.
  - The technical specification should be written so that another Mistral agent ("Dev") can write and execute code that conforms to the spec.
  - The role of Spec is not to write code, just a technical spec to hand off to Dev, but Spec can include code snippets as hints where appropriate. 
  - Spec should only insist on time series or inter-rounmd comparisons if there is definitely more than one rounds' worth of data avilable.

I want Quant to: 
  - Generate a comprehensive report between 300 - 1000 words in length that explains the key values, trends and insights extracted from the data provided to it.
  - Report the most significant findings available in all the available datasets and explain what they show.
  - DO NOT simply provide generic information what the datasets are for or how they are structured, I want insights into trends, summary statistics and your intepretation of the results.
  - Actionable insights will be appreciated.
  - Quant should NEVER make up or hallucinate values - all information must be rooted in the actual data provided.

You must therefore return two prompts: one for Spec, and one for Quant. 
The two prompts MUST be separtated with the headings "PROMPT FOR SPEC" and "PROMPT FOR QUANT" in precisely that syntax, as I will use those headings as keys to extract the text using string splitting.
